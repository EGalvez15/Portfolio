>In my previous line of work I had the role of a data analyst and have experience with the following: 
> * Team collaboration always trying to help others and coming up with ideas on how to imporve parts of a project
> * ETL processing on thousands of files in order to fully optimize data ingestion.

>   - S3 bucket filter to retrieve only necessary files within the S3 bucket
> * Snowflake software in order to provide the following:
>   - Data quality testing
>   - Recreating workflows from matillion in order to ensure logic of file processing is correct
>   - Table creating and transformation
